Introduction
------------

This tutorial shows how to use the quantized mesh tile module.
This format is designed to work exclusively with the `TMS (Tile Map Service)`_ tiling scheme
and is optimized to display `TIN (Triangulated irregular network)`_ data on the web.

.. _TMS (Tile Map Service):
    http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service_Specification
.. _TIN (Triangulated irregular network):
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulated_irregular_network

The only available client able to read and display this format is `Cesium`_.

This module has been developed based on the specifications of the format described `here`_.

Therefore, if you've planned on creating your own terrain server, please make sure you follow all the instructions
provided in the specifications of the format. You may also need to define a `layer.json`_ metadata file at the root of your
terrain server which seems to be a derivative of `Mapbox tilejson-spec`_. Make sure you get it right. ;)

Create a terrain tile
---------------------

The encoding module can determine the extent of a tile based on the geometries it receives as arguments.
Nevertheless, this can only work if the tile has at least 1 triangle on all of its 4 edges.
As a result, it is advised to always provide the bounds of the tile.

So first determine the extent of the tile.

  >>> from quantized_mesh_tile.global_geodetic import GlobalGeodetic
  >>> geodetic = GlobalGeodetic(True)
  >>> [z, x, y] = [9, 533, 383]
  >>> [west, south, east, north] = bounds = geodetic.TileBounds(x, y, z)

Now that we have the extent, let's assume you generated a mesh using your favorite meshing engine and ended up with
the following geometries.

  >>> geometries = [
          'POLYGON Z ((7.3828125 44.6484375 303.3, ' +
                      '7.3828125 45.0 320.2, ' +
                      '7.5585937 44.82421875 310.2, ' +
                      '7.3828125 44.6484375 303.3))',
          'POLYGON Z ((7.3828125 44.6484375 303.3, ' +
                      '7.734375 44.6484375 350.3, ' +
                      '7.5585937 44.82421875 310.2, ' +
                      '7.3828125 44.6484375 303.3))',
          'POLYGON Z ((7.734375 44.6484375 350.3, ' +
                      '7.734375 45.0 330.3, ' +
                      '7.5585937 44.82421875 310.2, ' +
                      '7.734375 44.6484375 350.3))',
          'POLYGON Z ((7.734375 45.0 330.3, ' +
                      '7.5585937 44.82421875 310.2, ' +
                      '7.3828125 45.0 320.2, ' +
                      '7.734375 45.0 330.3))'
      ]

For a full list of input formats for the geometries, please refer to :class:`quantized_mesh_tile.terrain.TerrainTile`.

  >>> from quantized_mesh_tile import encode
  >>> tile = encode(geometries, bounds=bounds)
  >>> print len(tile.getTrianglesCoordinates())
  >>> tile.toFile('%s/%s/%s.terrain' % (z, x, y))

This operation will write a local file representing the terrain tile.
If you don't want to create a physical file but only need its content, you can use:

  >>> tile = encode(geometries, bounds=bounds)
  >>> content = tile.toBytesIO(gzipped=True)

This operation will create a gzipped compressed string buffer wrapped in a `io.BytesIO` instance.

If you want to enable lighting effect (experimental):

  >>> tile = encode(geometries, bounds=bounds, hasLighting=True)
  >>> content = tile.toBytesIO(gzipped=True)

To define a water-mask you can use:

  >>> # Water only
  >>> watermask = [255]
  >>> tile = encode(geometries, bounds=bounds, watermask=watermask)

If you have non-triangular geometries (typically when clipping in an existing mesh),
you can also use the option `autocorrectGeometries` to collapse them into triangles.
This option should be used with care to fix punctual meshing mistakes.

  >>> geometries = [
          'POLYGON Z ((7.3828125 44.6484375 303.3, ' +
                      '7.3828125 45.0 320.2, ' +
                      '7.5585937 44.82421875 310.2, ' +
                      '7.3828125 44.6484375 303.3))',
          'POLYGON Z ((7.3828125 44.6484375 303.3, ' +
                      '7.734375 44.6484375 350.3, ' +
                      '7.5585937 44.82421875 310.2, ' +
                      '7.3828125 44.6484375 303.3))',
          'POLYGON Z ((7.734375 44.6484375 350.3, ' +
                      '7.734375 45.0 330.3, ' +
                      '7.5585937 44.82421875 310.2, ' +
                      '7.734375 44.6484375 350.3))',
          'POLYGON Z ((7.734375 45.0 330.3, ' +
                      '7.5585937 44.82421875 310.2, ' +
                      '7.3828125 45.0 320.2, ' +
                      '7.55859375 45.0 325.2, ' +
                      '7.734375 45.0 330.3))'
      ]
  >>> tile = encode(geometries, bounds=bounds, autocorrectGeometries=True)
  >>> print len(tile.getTrianglesCoordinates())


Read a local terrain tile
-------------------------

As the coordinates within a terrain tile are `quantized`, its values can be only be correctly decoded if we know the exact
extent of the tile.

  >>> from quantized_mesh_tile.global_geodetic import GlobalGeodetic
  >>> geodetic = GlobalGeodetic(True)
  >>> [z, x, y] = [9, 533, 383]
  >>> [west, south, east, north] = bounds = geodetic.TileBounds(x, y, z)
  >>> path = '%s/%s/%s.terrain' % (z, x, y)
  >>> tile = decode(path, bounds)
  >>> print tile.getTrianglesCoordinates()

Or let's assume we have a gizpped compressed tile with water-mask extension:

  >>> tile = decode(path, bounds, gzipped=True, hasWatermask=True)

Read a remote terrain tile
--------------------------

Using the `requests module`_, here is an example on how to read a remote terrain tile.

.. _requests module:
    http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/

The you won't need to decompress the gzipped tile has this is performed automatically
in the requests module.

  >>> from io import BytesIO
  >>> import requests
  >>> from quantized_mesh_tile.terrain import TerrainTile
  >>> from quantized_mesh_tile.global_geodetic import GlobalGeodetic
  >>> [z, x, y] = [14, 24297, 10735]
  >>> geodetic = GlobalGeodetic(True)
  >>> [west, south, east, north] = bounds = geodetic.TileBounds(x, y, z)
  >>> url = 'http://assets.agi.com/stk-terrain/world/%s/%s/%s.terrain?v=1.16389.0' % (z, x, y)
  >>> response = requests.get(url)
  >>> content = BytesIO(response.content)
  >>> ter = TerrainTile(west=west, south=south, east=east, north=north)
  >>> ter.fromBytesIO(content)
  >>> print ter.getVerticesCoordinates()
